This is a "paper" repo for the writeup for CS261n.

Vern's original feedback, to incorporate: (sigh..)

* Your related work framing needs to more explicitly frame what you are
seeking to do beyond what [4,12] already did, as between them they sound
like they cover your topic a fair amount.  In addition, what's in the
literature regarding general browser usability issues?
* 9-point font - yuck!  Please absorb the writing style points at
http://www.icir.org/vern/cs261n/writing.html , including font size
for what you submit for the course.
* What's an "average Tor user"?
* What have bug reports from users (regardless of their biased nature)
revealed?  What about "anecdotes"?  What's "surprising" about research
on attacks on Tor users?  What did Le Blond find?  (note: not "Blond")
* "have the potential to greatly affect user behavior" - tell us how
* "have a history of failing to inform users" - provide citation.  In addition,
is it a failure to *inform* users, or a failure to *effectively* inform
them (i.e., they're informed, but it doesn't much help).
* Avoid Wikipedia (in particular), web-only resources (in general), technical
reports, and arXiv preprints, when more stable/peer-reviewed references
exist that are equivalent or analogous.
* "this human factors field has traditionally played a limited role in
research [5]." - that cite is 10 years old.  Has this changed since then?
* "Currently, a wide range of people use Tor Browser, including normal people" -
what does "normal people" mean?  In addition, do you have a citation for
the makeup of the list here, or is this pretty much just going with what
the Tor Project asserts?
* "As a whole, Tor is very usable" - citation required.
* "This is evidenced by the popularity of the system" - the logic doesn't
follow.  It could be popular even though not "very usable".
* "Clark's usability study" - citation missing
* "changes made should be in communicating to users" - what changes?
* What was Clark's methodology?  How about in [9] and [12]?
* Work by Norcie investigates "stop points" - what were these?  What's
the associated analysis/interpretation?
* Citation [13] doesn't have a venue, and has peculiar authorship.
